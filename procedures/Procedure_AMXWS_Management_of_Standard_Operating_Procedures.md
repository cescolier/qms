## Procedure

### Document Change Request

Upon identification of a requirement for a new procedure or update to a procedure or associated documents (forms/appendices) the Requestor creates a GitHub Issue with the "Document Change Request" label.

If a new document needs to be created, a new 5 letter random code is generated, using the [List of documents]() spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is subsequently updated with the new document in draft status, and submitted to the repository.

The author is identified using the discussion features of GitHub Issues.

### Sections

All procedures include the following sections:

* Purpose
* Department
* References and Associated Documents
* Roles
* Procedure
* Training

Where a particular section is not required, it must still be included with the words ”None”, ”Not Applicable”, ”NA".

### Nomenclature

Each procedure and document of the QMS has a unique, random, 5 letter document code, in addition to having a meaningful title.

#### Departent

The departments can be:

* Compliance
* Clinical
* Commercial
* Cross—Functional
* Finance
* Information Technology
* Human Resources
* Legal
* Medical affairs
* Information
* Pharmacovigilance
* Quality
* Regulatory Affairs
* Supply Chain

Procedures to be identified as Cross Functional are those which are applicable to each Theramex employee or where the responsibility/ownership is shared across two or more departments.

### Authoring

The author is identified via a discusisonon the GitHub Issues platform. The author must be suitably knowledgeable on the target subject matter.

The author will collaborate with peers and subject matter experts before submitting the draft for approval.

Associated documents (forms) may be revised separately from the procedure revision process, the author revising the form will be responsible to assess all corresponding documents as part of the change process.

### Review and Approval

Procedures and associated documents must be reviewed for use by at least one competent person in the area they relate to.

Procedures and associated documents must be approved for use by a senior competent person in the area to which the Document relates. All SOPs relating to GDP activities must be approved by a Responsible Person.

The approval procedure is performed using GitHub's pull request feature. When the draft is reviewed and finalized, the author submits a pull request to integrate his changes into the master, which are the in force documents.

The approval of pull requests is considered equivalent to a wet signature.

### Effective Date

Unless otherwise noted in the purpose section approved procedures are applicable immediately.

Training of the relevant employees should take place before the approval of the procedure.

### Training

The Author, in consultation with departmental management and subject matter experts, will agree the level of training required for users of each procedure.

### Periodic Review

All Theramex SOPs relating to GxP must be reviewed at least every two years. The review process should begin at least three months before the relevant anniversary of the effective date to enable sufficient time to engage all stakeholders and gain approval of the revised SOP before the required anniversary.

### Withdrawal

When there is no longer a need for a document, the request is raised and discussed using GitHub Issues, with the label Document Withdrawal Request. 

Withdrawal must be communicated to those who used the document before withdrawal.

The Index of Controlled Documents must be updated to reflect the changed status of the document.
